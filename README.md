NyTimes is an simple application created by mahmod masoud it contains the folowing featuers 

* We use an MVC design pattern to build this app by deviding project structor into three layers view for activities and model for enties 
  and the last one controller for network connection 

* We use Singlton design pattern in this project  to handle network layer to api thrugh volly network library 

* We use BaseActivity class to handle show loading dialog and dismiss loading dialog and show error messages in the appliation 

* We use recyclerview to display news from NYTimes api 

* the source code is writed uiing clean object oriented structre and with standard naming convention and scope for the variables 

* and finally you can downlaod the source code and test it using test unit you need or open it using android studio
